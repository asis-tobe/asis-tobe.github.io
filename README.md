# AsIs-ToBe Configurator

The **AsIs-ToBe Configurator** is a client-side diagramming tool to capture the current (as-is) prospect's or customer's data pipeline from end to end and discover potential opportunities for improvement (to-be).
It's also a great tool to set up a POC for success and then play out the value that the real-time database was adding to the business, especially for non-technical audiences, as it explains things very graphically.

üõ†Ô∏è**Tech:** It was created using a viz library from Ant Design called "X6" [antvix/X6](https://github.com/antvis/X6). All React and TS.  
‚ö°**Fun Fact:** There are no databases or state management; it's all URL encoded and then shortened.
