# AsIs-ToBe Configurator

The AsIs-ToBe Configurator is a client-side diagramming tool to capture current **(as-is)** data pipelines from end to end and discover potential opportunities for improvement **(to-be)**.

Itâ€™s also a great tool to play out the value that these deployments are adding to the business, especially for non-technical audiences, as it explains things in a very graphical way.
